You're correct that splitting the workflow into multiple files may result in multiple containers being created, each running a separate job. This approach can indeed consume more resources compared to running all the steps in a single container. However, there are trade-offs to consider:

1. Isolation: Running each job in its own container provides isolation between the jobs. This can be beneficial if one job fails or experiences issues, as it won't affect the execution of other jobs.
2. Parallelism: Splitting the workflow into multiple jobs allows for parallel execution, which can reduce overall workflow runtime. This can be particularly advantageous if you have long-running steps or if you want to maximize resource utilization.
3. Maintenance: Splitting the workflow into smaller, focused files can improve maintainability and readability, as each file is dedicated to a specific task or job. This can make it easier to understand and update the workflow over time.
4. Resource Usage: While running multiple containers may consume more resources, GitHub Actions provides a generous allocation of resources for each job. Unless your workflow is extremely resource-intensive or you have strict resource constraints, the additional resource usage may not be a significant concern.

Ultimately, whether to split the workflow into multiple files depends on your project's specific requirements, preferences, and resource constraints. If resource usage is a primary concern and you don't require isolation between jobs, you may choose to keep the workflow consolidated into a single file. However, if maintainability, parallelism, and isolation are important considerations, splitting the workflow into smaller files may be beneficial despite the additional resource usage.
